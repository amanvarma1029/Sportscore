    <div>
        <h4 id="para2"><i>Former India batter Gautam Gambhir agreed with this assessment, offering a candid evaluation
                of India's performance against Sri Lanka. Notably, it was the first time that India had lost all 10
                wickets to spin, highlighting the growing challenge posed by spin bowlers in international
                cricket.Speaking to Star Sports during the rain delay after the 47th over of India's innings, Gambhir
                recalled how the Indian batters had incurred a similar problem when they were up against the likes of
                Adam Zampa and Ashton Agar in the Australia ODI game earlier this year in Chennai. Six wickets were
                picked between the two as India fell 21 runs short in chasing 270. Explaining the dismissals on Tuesday,
                Gambhir pointed out how three of the five dismissals happened because the batters were committed on
                their front foot.</i></h4>

    <div>
        <h4 id="para3"><i>"This is becoming a pattern. You remember that match against Australia in Chennai when the
                ball was gripping a bit and India were chasing some 260 odd runs against spinners like Adam Zampa and
                Ashton Agar. And we couldn't chase it. Whenever the ball grips, we struggle and we don't even know
                whether we can take the game deep. This is not a 350-run wicket...it's of 270. Imagine if in 40 overs
                you are three down for 160 or 170, then when the ball grips, it is very important for the batters to
                adjust. Virat Kohli and KL Rahul's were soft dismissals, but rest were beaten by the front foot. Rohit
                Sharma was beaten by pace, Gill by...that was a brilliant ball. You expect better from Indian batters,"
